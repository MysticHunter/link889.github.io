					<h3>Chp 1 What Makes A Good Dictator</h3>
					<p>
						Adolf Hitler is smart, powerful, and brave.  He was smart because he made a no tobacco law so the people of his military and NAZI’s would not die from smoking.  He is powerful because he made the stormtroopers and the NAZI party.  Lastly he is brave because he received the iron cross which is rare for foot soldiers.

					<h3>Chp2 Choosing The Right Environment</h3>
					<p>
						It takes the right environment for the wrong leader to come into power. World War 1 took a huge toll on Germany.  Many countries blamed Germany for the war.  The Treaty of Versaille had severe repercussions for Germany.  Germans felt betrayed and isolated after the war.  The environment in Germany that helped Hitler rise to power was because of economic ruin, German morale and political instability.
					</p>
						<br>
					<p>
						Germany’s economy was in ruin after World War 1.  The Treaty of Versailles made the German government repay the costs of the entire war.  The Holocaust Explained states, “The terms of the Treaty of Versailles ordered that Germany had to pay huge sums in reparations to the Allies”  (2011).  People lost their jobs from lack of money from war payments and from the Great Depression.  World War 1 Aftermath states, “This hyperinflationary period combined with the effects of the Great Depression (beginning in 1929) to seriously undermine the stability of the German economy, wiping out the personal savings of the middle class and spurring massive unemployment.”  Germany began printing extra money after the war to pay people's wages.  People’s wages got really low after the war because companies could not trade because of the treaty.  The government also printed so much money that the German currency lost its value.  Germany had lot’s of economic problems before the second world war because of the Treaty of Versaille and the start of the Great Depression.
					</p>
						<br>
					<p>
						German morale took a big hit after World War 1.   Germany was not allowed to have an army any more.  In an article written by Carlos Magana, he says, “The great German army had been dismantled and that was another humiliating factor of the Versailles Treaty” (2003).  Germany was blamed for the entire war.  Carlos Magana states, “All people affected by the war wanted Germany to be punished” (2003).  Germans felt betrayed by their own government and the rest of Europe.  World War 1 Aftermath states, “The social and economic upheaval that followed World War I powerfully destabilized Germany's fledgling democracy and gave rise to many radical right wing parties in Weimar Germany.”  German morale was not high after the world war because of the blame and sanctions put on Germany after World War 1.
					</p>
						<br>
					<p>
						Political instability caused many extremist groups to attempt to take control of the government.  The people got uneasy because the government was weak and could be easily taken over.  The Treaty of Versailles had not only taken away the German army, the rest of the world would not trade with them and would impose heavy taxes on Germany.  The government defaulted on their war payments.  According to Daniel Castillo, “Faced with reparation payments they could not afford, Germany began printing exaggerated amounts of money” (2003).  There were uprisings against the new German Republic.  According to The Seeds of Evil: The Rise of Hitler “As a result extremist views, such as communism, became widely supported, particularly in the industrial cities” (2004).  Political instability had a huge impact on the German government.
					</p>
						<br>
					<p>
						The environment was just right for a dictator to come into power in Germany.  The Treaty of Versailles had severely limited the nation's army and navy.  Germany’s economic state was in ruin because of the debt that they were told to pay for the damages during the war.  Germany began printing excess money to not default on their debts, but in doing so they caused the overinflation of the German Mark.  The people of Germany were sad because they were blamed for the entire war.  Germany felt betrayed by their government which led to the rise of many extremist groups.  Economic ruin, political instability, and poor morale led to the German people allowing Hitler to take control.
